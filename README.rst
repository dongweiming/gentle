What is a Gentle?
======

As a programmer, I thought There may be a step to deployed to the test
environment:

- Copy of your code to the test server, enter the username and password.
- Restart your test environment, such as nginx, superviosr.
- Local to see results, repeat 1-2

It is a waste of time...

Gentle can help you automated do that. The development process is:

- Switch to the directory you want to develop
- Initialization gentle:

  - configure the directory you want to sync (use rsync)
  - set the test environment server ip, port, username and password
  - configure every time you want to update the code in the service restart

- You only need coding and following this command::

    $gt publish

  If You are more lazyer, you can use::

    $gt p

That's all

Install
=====
    First You must install `sshpass`, IN fabric rsync_project need input
    password again. I use sshpass automation of this process

    In ubuntu direct use apt-get/aptitude::

      $sudo apt-get install sshpass

    Other platform, Go ``http://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass`` donwload
    the lastest verison, then type the following command::

      $tar zxvf sshpass-1.05.tar.gz && cd sshpass-1.05
      $./configure && make && sudo make install

    Then install `gentle`, You only use::

      $sudo pip install gentle

    or::

      $git clone https://github.com/dongweiming/gentle
      $cd gentle
      $sudo python setup.py install
